Advanced Driving Algorithm:

1: The robot starts in a random square on the grid
2: It recognizes the nearnest squares to itself (potentially an initial turn is done as well explained later)
3: If possible, the robot drives straight else left else right assuming that all adjacent spaces are undiscovered
4: While driving the robot keeps track of the spaces that it has physically passed over as well as the undiscovered parts
5: If the robot surrounds itself with undiscovered points, it initiates an A* algorithm to find the nearnest undiscovered part
6: The robot then repeats breath first search.
